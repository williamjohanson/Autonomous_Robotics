    Parameters
    ----------

    particle_poses: an M x 3 array of particle_poses where M is the
    number of particles.  Each pose is (x, y, theta) where x and y are
    in metres and theta is in radians.

    speed_command: a two element array of the current commanded speed
    vector, (v, omega), where v is the forward speed in m/s and omega
    is the angular speed in rad/s.

    odom_pose: the current local odometry pose (x, y, theta).

    odom_pose_prev: the previous local odometry pose (x, y, theta).

    dt is the time step (s).

    Returns
    -------
